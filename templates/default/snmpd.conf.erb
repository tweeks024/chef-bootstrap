# snmpd.conf:
#   An example configuration file for configuring the ucd-snmp snmpd agent.
#
###############################################################################
#
# This file is intended to only be as a starting point.  Many more
# configuration directives exist than are mentioned in this file.  For
# full details, see the snmpd.conf(5) manual page.
#
# All lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are intended for you
# to read.  All other lines are configuration commands for the agent.

# Access Control
###############################################################################

# As shipped, the snmpd demon will only respond to queries on the
# system mib group until this file is replaced or modified for
# security purposes.  Examples are shown below about how to increase the
# level of access.

# By far, the most common question I get about the agent is "why won't
# it work?", when really it should be "how do I configure the agent to
# allow me to access it?"
#
# By default, the agent responds to the "public" community for read
# only access, if run out of the box without any configuration file in
# place.  The following examples show you other ways of configuring
# the agent so that you can change the community names, and give
# yourself write access to the mib tree as well.
#
# For more information, read the FAQ as well as the snmpd.conf(5)
# manual page.

####
# First, map the community name "public" into a "security name"

#       sec.name  source          community
com2sec notConfigUser  default       someSNMPCommunity


####
# Second, map the security name into a group name:

#       groupName      securityModel securityName
group MyRWGroup v1         notConfigUser
group MyRWGroup usm        notConfigUser
group MyROGroup v1         notConfigUser
group MyROGroup v2c        notConfigUser
group MyROGroup usm        notConfigUser

####
# Third, create a view for us to let the group have rights to:

# Make at least  snmpwalk -v 1 localhost -c public system fast again.
#       name           incl/excl     subtree         mask(optional)
view    all            included      .1              80

####
# Finally, grant the group read-only access to the systemview view.

#       group          context sec.model sec.level prefix read   write  notif
access MyROGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  all    none   none
access MyRWGroup ""      any       noauth    exact  all    all    none
